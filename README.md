# Mission Red

## Problem Statement :
Menstruation or periods are the normal and healthy part of life of women. But, lack of availability of sanitary products and hygienic infrastructure exacerbate the problem for women during their menstrual cycle leaving them in helpless and isolated state. Also, entrenched stigma and taboos related to menstruation worsen the situation for women. Hence, drastic changes are needed to encourage positive social norms and ultimately enact behavioural change towards menstruation process.

## Introduction :
Mission Red is a web portal that aims to create awareness about menstruation and provide solutions to the general problems faced by women during this phase. It provides doctor's consultation support, delivery service by stores selling sanitary products, periods tracker and blog writing section to publicly discuss about menstruation.

## Idea Effectiveness :
According to National Family Health Survey 2015-2016 out of the 336 million menstruating women in India only about 121 million (roughly 36 percent) women use sanitary napkins. As per report by the NGO Dasra, almost 23 million girls in India drop out of school annually, because of lack of menstrual hygiene management facilities, including availability of sanitary napkins and awareness about menstruation. Also, only 50% of the girls are aware about mensturation process before enter they enter in this phase. So, significant steps are needed to create awareness about menstruation process and reduce period poverty.
